Installation
====================================

As `pycrispr` is a library that is based on the Python-based `snakemake <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html>`_ pipeline software, it is recommended to install the `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ package manager first:

.. code-block:: console
   
   $ curl micro.mamba.pm/install.sh | bash


Next `snakemake` can be installed with the following commands

.. code-block:: console
   
   $ conda activate base
   $ mamba create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n snakemake snakemake

This will create a new virtual environment named `snakemake`.

From this virtual environment, run the following commands to install `pycrispr`:

.. code-block:: console

   $  mamba activate snakemake
   $  cd /path/of/choice 
   $  git clone https://github.com/niekwit/pycrispr.git
   $  cd pycrispr
   $  pip install .

To update `pycrispr` to the latest version run:

.. code-block:: console

   $  cd /path/of/pycrispr 
   $  git pull
   $  pip install --upgrade .
