====================================
Hardware

``pycrispr`` has minimal system requirements:

* Memory: 8 GB of RAM (for whole-genome libraries)

It can easily be run on an old laptop or from a GNU/Linux virtual machine if you run Windows as your main operating system.

------------------------------------

``pycrispr`` requires a Unix environment and has been tested on the following GNU/Linux distributions:

* Fedora 37/38
* Ubuntu 20.04.06

It should also be possible to run ``pycrispr`` on MacOS via *Conda/Mamba* but this has not been tested yet.
